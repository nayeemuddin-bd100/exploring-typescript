# Exploring TypeScript

Welcome to the "Exploring TypeScript" repository! This project documents my learning journey with TypeScript, a powerful and statically-typed superset of JavaScript.

# Running TypeScript File with Nodemon

To run a TypeScript file using Nodemon, follow these steps:

1. Install Nodemon globally (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the TypeScript file using Nodemon:
   ```bash
   nodemon src/Explanation/11.oop.ts
   ```

Nodemon will watch for changes in your TypeScript file and automatically restart the server when changes are detected.
